## Introduction
### Background
The Nutrient App project aims at supporting the reduction of nutrient export to rivers and lakes by engaging citizens, farmers and water quality managers in the real-time monitoring of dissolved nutrient concentrations  (N, P) in aquatic freshwater systems. The mobile application allows obtaining on-farm instantaneous community-based nutrient measurements based on cheap standard commercially available test kits. The mobile app can be used to monitor the quality of wells, streams, wetlands and lakes. It will enable to identify possible sources and hotspots of contamination, which will empower the participants to take remedial action. The measurements are georeferenced and can be uploaded to a server managed by the GWFâ€™s data management team. The results will be displayed in a map that can be visualized directly through the app or from a web browser for further analysis.
